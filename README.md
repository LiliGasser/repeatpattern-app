# Repeat Climate Action Pattern

Created during CAS Generative Data Design at Hochschule für Künste Bern, August–September 2025.

**[Start creating yourself](https://rcap-app.netlify.app):** Design your climate postcards with generative patterns.

This is the Vue.js adaption of the [original JavaScript version](https://github.com/LiliGasser/repeatpattern).

## Project description

The global climate change survey found that the majority of people in Switzerland and across the world are willing to fight global warning and underestimate the willingness of others. Also, the vast majority wants more climate action from the population and the national governments.

In this project, the main results are visually summarized for each country in a data-dependant motif, which is then repeated across a canvas using geometrical transformations.


## Purpose & goal

- Inform people about the Global Climate Change Survey and its results.
- Translate the main results from the survey to a visual motif, from which a repeat pattern is generated.
- Provide a tool to create several motifs and repeat patterns using simple geometrical transformations.
- Make the resulting repeat patterns shareable, e.g., as a post card.
- Provide an explanation for survey results and the derived motif and repeat patterns.


## Data sources & information

The [global climate change survey](https://gccs.iza.org/) was published in 2024 [1]. In 125 countries across the world, 130'000 people were asked four questions:
1. **WTP, willingness to particispate:** Would you be willing to contribute 1% of your household income every month to fight global warming?
2. **WTP Belief:** We are asking this question to 100 other respondents in your country. How many do you think are willing to contribute at least 1% of their household income every month to fight global warming?
3. **Social Norm:** Do you think that people in your country should try to fight global warming? 
4. **Government:** Do you think the national government should do more to fight global warming?

For detailed information, check the [survey website](https://gccs.iza.org/) and the [publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-01925-3).

Here, summary data per country is used (see `data/gccs_country_with_temperature_and_gdp.csv`), which was provided by the study authors. From the four questions, the amount of approval is calculated as percentage value.


## How it works

The app can be used to create A6 post cards (148mm x 105mm) for countries with repeat patterns based on the global climate change survery data.

There are several options in the app:
- Country
- Pattern:
    - Motif
    - Symmetry
    - Show grid
- Postcard setup
    - Layout
    - Size of frame around pattern as ratio
    - Number of motifs per row
    - Relative motif size (within a cell)
- Color
    - Color palette
    - Colors for the four variables and the background
- Typeface
    - Title (on the back of the postcard)
    - Text
- Export button


For each setting, the front and back of a postcard are created. The front contains the repeat pattern and the country name. The motif is explained on the back. 


## Technologies used

- **p5.js**: canvas rendering, repeat pattern creation, postcard front and back creation
- **p5-svg.js**: canvas rendering as svg
- **d3.js**: data loading and scaling
- **HTML**: structure and semantic markup
